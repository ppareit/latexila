Guidelines for LaTeXila
=======================

LaTeXila source code is maintained using the Git version control system
and is available at the following location:

    git://github.com/swilmet/latexila.git

A Web Interface is available at:

    http://github.com/swilmet/latexila

You can download the source code from the Git repository by doing:

    $ git clone git://github.com/swilmet/latexila.git

Later, to take the new commits you just have to do:

    $ git pull


If you want to contribute to LaTeXila, contact the main developer (see the file AUTHORS).
Here is how you can generate a patch:

    $ git diff origin > patch

But a pull request is better.

There are some rules to follow when coding:
    - indentation: 4 spaces
    - lines: 90 characters maximum (in some cases it can be a little more)
    - same coding style everywhere


Translations
============

How to generate latexila.pot?

    $ ./update_pot.sh

How to update the *.po files with latexila.pot file?

    $ cd build/ ; cmake ../
    $ make

How to create a new *.po for a new language?

    $ cd po/ ; msginit -l xx -o xx.po -i latexila.pot

How to translate LaTeXila?

    There is obviously the *.po file to translate. You can use Poedit for
    example. Here are some strange items to translate:
        - translator-credits: Your name <your@email> (so your name will appear
          in the about dialog)

        Templates:
        - article-en.tex: article-xx.tex ("en" stands for English)
        - beamer-en.tex: beamer-xx.tex
        - book-en.tex: book-xx.tex
        - letter-en.tex: letter-xx.tex
        - report-en.tex: report-xx.tex

        Build Tools:
        - build_tools-en.xml: build_tools-xx.xml

        You will see a lot of items with an underscore. It's used for
        shortcuts (Alt + Letter underlined). If possible it is better to avoid
        having several times the same letter in the same menu.

    There is also the templates to translate in data/templates/ and the build
    tools in data/build_tools/. For the templates, add support for your
    language (in most cases add the babel package).

    Finally, there are two little sentences in data/latexila.desktop.

    Thanks!
