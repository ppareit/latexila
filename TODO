The Roadmap is less detailed, but have a long-term view.
The TODO is more detailed, but focus more on the short-term.

- Migrate to GTK+ 3 [in progress]
	- It's not a high priority, since it's not a big issue for GNOME 3 users,
	  but it would be nice. The problem is that it involves a lot of work,
	  more than expected. See the branch gnome-3.

	- GtkBox -> GtkGrid
	- right click on document tab (the gray zone is ugly)
	- remove the border of toolbars
	- reduce some widgets sizes (some are too big)
	- use GtkApplication instead of Unique
	- test dev version of GtkSpell
	- replace gtk_source_completion_info_set_sizing()

- Improve completion:
	- complete placeholders (\ref, \cite, ...)
	  (take into account all *.tex, *.bib, ... files of the project)

	- show details by default (now we have to click on the button to see
	  the details)

	- Insert an image easily. Instead of a wizzard, the approach is to:
		- have very good completion of:
			- \begin{figure}[here]
			- \includegraphics[here]{and here}
		- automatically complete the label with the filename of the image

	  A big disadvantage of a wizzard is: how to modify easily the image afterwards?
	  Generally, in this case, the user deletes the LaTeX code and re-run the wizzard…

(-) Structure:
	- Select the current section or item when the document cursor moves

	- Update on the fly the structure when the document is modified.
	  An item can be inserted, deleted or modified.
	  The simplest way I think is to re-run the parsing only on the modified
	  lines (with a lower and upper bounds) every 2 seconds for example.
	  This way, we simply delete all items between the two bounds, and the
	  parsing will re-add them correctly.

(-) Edit toolbar: create a custom MenuToolButton:
	Now the icon does nothing when we click on it, we must always click
	first on the arrow and then select the item. It would be better if
	the icon is the last item used (and we can click on it).

	A drawback is that the button would take more place, this can be a
	problem for small screens.
